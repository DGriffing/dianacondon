              We created an intuitive iOS and android mobile app that lets users check-in at USC Events using Bluetooth beacons to earn
              points for their account. USC Events gets to determine how many points users receive for particular events,
              along with the prizes they can redeem. Prizes include being added to a show's VIP list, or receiving a merchandise
              voucher that can be redeemed at a USC Events booth.

              USC Events is the leading music festival and events company in Washington state, with over 200,000 annual show attendees.
              Despite this volume of success, USC Events does not have an app where people can find their events or a system
              that rewards consistent attendees. Thus, we covered both of these key business needs by developing iOS and
              Android mobile applications for USC Events. Our apps will significantly enhance the music show experience for
              a substantial amount of the 200,000 annual attendees. We fully completed the app’s design and development’s
              MVP for launch.

              Science Everywhere is an NSF funded research study aimed at understanding how technology can engage entire communities in
              science learning. We utilize a design-based research approach in which we co-design innovative science learning
              technology with families, teachers, and leaders in a community, implement that technology in the community,
              and then redesign that technology in an iterative design process. Broadly, this study will contribute to theory
              on connected learning by developing an understanding of how to connect science learning at home, school, and
              community spaces with technology. This study also aims to contribute to our understanding of parent-child learning,
              interactive display design, and social media for learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Science Everywhere we run after school programs that focus on science learning in life relevant contexts. Programs include
              topics like kitchen chemistry, engineering and design through Minecraft, and investigating how things fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this study we developed a suite of science learning technologies. These technologies include a social media app for science
              learning and an interactive display for schools and public spaces.
